= Fabric8 Toggles

Unleash-server bundled for OpenShift deployment. Loosely based on https://github.com/Unleash/unleash-docker

== Build
```
npm install
```

== Dev deployment

=== Pre-requisites
2 options to run the DB:

* either Deploy on minishift see https://github.com/xcoulon/fabric8-minishift/blob/master/toggles-db.yml[toggles-db.yml]
* or run locally postgres

=== Without authentication

* Test in dev mode without GH auth/authz
```
DEV_MODE=true DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@MINISHIFT_IP:31210/unleashdb npm start
```
where MINISHIFT_IP is where you DB is deployed and 31210 the port where it's running. It could be minishift or locally.

* Debug
```
DEV_MODE=true DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@MINISHIFT_IP:31210/unleashdb npm run start:debug
```
Open chrome with `chrome://inspect` and choose Remote Target to open a chrome too.

=== With GH auth/authz

==== pre-requisites

You need to configure GH OAuth app to test it locally:

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/applications/new[OAuth app]
1. Create a new developer application, in the `Authorization callback URL`, 
1. Enter the url `http://localhost:4242/api/auth/callback`.

You'll get a page with `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`.

> NOTE: The URL you enter should should match the env variable `GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL` you'll use to start the server 

=== Run
To test with GH authorization targeting prod-preview GH teams

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@MINISHIFT_IP:31210/unleashdb GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=YYY GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=XXX GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:4242/api/auth/callback npm start
```


== Deployment on minishift

=== Pre-requisites
* Install https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/getting-started/installing.html[Minishift]
* Install OpenShift command oc
* Start minishift
```
minishift start --memory=7000 --cpus=4 --disk-size=50g
```
on macOS:
```
minishift start --vm-driver=xhyve --memory=7000 --cpus=4 --disk-size=50g
```
* Point `oc` to Minishift
```
oc config use-context minishift
oc login -u developer -p developer
```
=== Build docker image and push to minishift repo

(optional) if you want to start deleting any existing `fabric8` project in your minishift:
```
make clean-minishift
```
and once ready:

```
make push-minishift

```
> NOTE: To check the image was pushed to your minishift internal repo: `eval $(minishift docker-env)` and `docker images`

=== Deploy to minishift
As pre-requisites, make sure you have your GH OAuth app created.

```
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=XXX GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=YYY GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL=http://toggles-fabric8.192.168.64.6.nip.io/api/auth/callback TOGGLES_ORG=push.registry.devshift.net/fabric8-services GITHUB_ORG=rhdt-toggles-test GITHUB_TEAM=toggles-admin-test TOGGLES_CONTEXT='' make deploy-minishift
```
to deploy to minishift using the CI?/CD image.

> NOTE 1: If you want to use CI/CD image run `TOGGLES_ORG=registry.devshift.net/fabric8-services/fabric8-toggles make deploy-minishift`

> NOTE 2: Pre-fix the target with relevant env variables:

 * either with auth: `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL`, `GITHUB_ORG`, `GITHUB_TEAM`.
 * or without auth: `DEV_MODE`


== Release

`fabric8-toggles` is a wrapper around https://github.com/Unleash/unleash[unleash-server] which depends on https://github.com/Unleash/unleash-frontend[unleash-frontend] upstream projects.
When we need different release cycle we use https://www.npmjs.com/package/f8-unleash-frontend[forked npm releases] until upstream projects released latest content.

=== Release unleash-frontent

```
npm login
npm publish
```

> NOTE: make sure unleash-server is pointing to your unleash-frontend release.

=== Release unleash

At the moment, we point to github branch to point to forked unleash-frontend release.
